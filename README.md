# Math-quiz
This is a simple math quiz about adding two numbers together.

I created this quiz using HTML and JavaScript.
As soon as the quiz is loaded two random numbers ranging from 0 to 1000 are generated and displayed for the user.
The user has to add the two numbers together and enter his answer into the input field.
Each correct answer awards the user with 1 point, while each incorrect answer subtracts the total score by 1.
The user can also see the current equation history of the quiz, which allows the user to compare his answer to the correct one.
After each answer a new set of numbers is generated.
